# DSC180A_Q1Project
Graph machine learning is becoming increasingly commonplace in the data science field due to a graph's ability to accurately capture relationships and connections in data, as compared to modeling with relational data. This project goes over node classification tasks in citation networks. Specifically, the focus will be on graph convolutional networks, or GCNs for short. The CiteSeer edge and node data being used can be found and downloaded here: https://deepai.org/dataset/citeseer.

Please run pip install -r requirements.txt and run.py to run this project.
